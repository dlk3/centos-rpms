#  RPM Package For CentOS

A collection of tools for building specific application packages that I use on
CentOS.  See the README.md files in each folder for additional details.

* transmission and libnatpmp, a pre-req for transmission
* opentracker

The centos-rpmbuild script found here will create the podman image that is used
by the mkrpms scripts that are in each individual application's folders.

The RPMs that I generated for each of these packages are attached in the 
[Releases](https://github.com/dlk3/centos-rpms/releases) tab of this repository.
