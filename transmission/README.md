#  trasnmission RPM Packages For CentOS

This folder contains SPEC files for two CentOS 7 packages, one for
transmission and another for libnatpmp, a pre-req for transmission.
Neither of these are currently available for CentOS 8 but were available
for CentOS 7.  It appears to be possible to build these packages 
unchanged in CentOS 8 and the automated build script in this folder will
do that.

TODO: test transmission under CentOS 8
